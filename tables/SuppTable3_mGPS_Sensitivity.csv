Weighting,C-index
Original (0/1/2),0.746
Binary (0/≥1),0.740
,
Notes:,
Comparison of original mGPS weighting (0/1/2 points) versus binary classification.,
Original weighting retained in final model for superior discrimination.,

Abbreviations: mGPS = modified Glasgow Prognostic Score.,

mGPS scoring: 0 = CRP ≤10 mg/L and albumin ≥35 g/L; 1 = CRP >10 mg/L or albumin <35 g/L; 2 = CRP >10 mg/L and albumin <35 g/L.,
