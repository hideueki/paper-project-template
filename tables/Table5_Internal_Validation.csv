Method,C-index,Note
Apparent (training),0.741,
5-fold cross-validation,0.742 ± 0.033,Mean ± SD across folds
Optimism-corrected (bootstrap),0.741,Optimism: -0.000
,,
Notes:,,
Internal validation performed using 5-fold cross-validation and bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations).,,
Optimism = apparent C-index minus bootstrap-corrected C-index.,,
